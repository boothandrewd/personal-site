# Post Dos

Made some minor updates to the [Projects][1] section, removing the borders and using a [grayscale filter][2] to indicate mouseover/interactivity. The added grayscale keeps with the theme of the page as well, though I've found I can't depart completely from including color. The code sections are still colored, and while I've tried the [grayscale syntax theme][3], I've found that it's detrimental to readability.

### Sooon

I'm working on a project. It will relate to Spotify. Be ready.

Seriously though, I have to wrestle with this [Node API][4] which, while useful, is a bit limited in what it can do in terms of user playlist manipulation. Luckily, if things go poorly I get to learn how to do it [the old fashioned way][5].

But, for now, check out my hit playlist, [Current Cuts][6]!
