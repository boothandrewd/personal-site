# First Post

So here I am again, trying to start a blog. Another homemade, [Markdown][1] based blog, where I guess I'm going to try to talk about coding and maybe some other stuff.

Anyway, it makes sense to start this first post off with a mention of my rebuilding of this website! This is actually the 3rd time I've built a personal website, the [first][2] was based on [Bootstrap][3] and [PHP][4], and the [second][5] was based on Python's [Flask][6] web framework, also built with [Bootstrap][3].

For [this iteration][7], (which hopefully lasts a bit longer than the others), I tried to go for a more *au natural* design, ditching standard do-all-the-work-for-you frontend libraries. Thus, if you do a `view source` on this page, you won't find [`jquery.min.js`][8] or [`bootstrap.min.css`][9] in the `header`. I also chose to build the backend on [Node][10] and [Express][11], mostly for my own edification.


### Design

So it's likely this website will go through several more design changes, both programmatically and visually, but for the most part, I've settled on a black-on-white, static, *scrolly* website being the design of choice, pinnacly inspired by [Koa][12] and [Vulfpeck][13]'s websites. Overall, however, it's not huge departure from the design mission I had for the [second iteration][5], [easter eggs][18] and all.

The *`scrollspy`* was the most interesting part to do by hand. Though it's far from perfect, it gets the job done. Shown in the following code, contents of the scroll-sensitive part of the page are watched via the [`'scroll'`][17] event.
``` JavaScript
var stage = document.getElementsByClassName('stage')[0];
stage.addEventListener('scroll', function(){ /* Keep reading */ });
```

The `scrollspy` uses the top of my *`mugshot`* as a reference point, looking for a section to come into range.
```JavaScript
  /* ...within the `addEventListener` callback */

  // Get the mugshot top
  var mugshot_top = mugshot.getBoundingClientRect().top;

  // Loop through sections and test relation to mugshot
  var sections = document.getElementsByTagName('section');
  for(var counter = sections.length-1; counter >= 0; counter--){
    var section = sections[counter];

    // Get scene to compare to mugshot
    var scene = section.getElementsByClassName('scene')[0];
    var scene_top = scene.getBoundingClientRect().top;

    // Set scene if close enough
    if(mugshot_top-30 < scene_top && scene_top < mugshot_top+30){
      window.location.hash = section.id;
    }
  }
```

Meanwhile, an event handler has been defined for the [`window.onhashchange`](15) event, which updates the menu accordingly.
```JavaScript
// Gets called on hash change and page load
function update_page(){
  // Get hash
  var anchor = window.location.hash;
  var unhashed_anchor = anchor.replace('#', '');
  // Update menu
  update_menu(unhashed_anchor);
}

// Add event listener
window.onhashchange = update_page;
```

This means that the page can be updated simply from a `hashchange` event, which serves as a more natural, *browsery* way to keep things up to date.


### Future Plans

First and foremost: I hope to keep this blog updated. I've tried starting on a number of times, but typically I run out of steam a few posts in. I've been hobby-coding quite frequently, which provides plenty to talk about.

I do, however, hope to improve the *blogginess* of this website, i.e. adding `anchors` to the blog posts, and adding them to the menu. Additionally, I would like to add other hobby pages, since there are things that go on in my life other than coding.
